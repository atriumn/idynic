-- Test fixtures for integration tests
-- These are applied after database reset and before tests run
--
-- IMPORTANT: Do NOT create test users here. Users should be created
-- via the auth API in tests so we get proper auth sessions.
--
-- This file is for reference data that tests need to exist.

-- Currently no reference data is needed for Phase 1 integration tests.
-- Future additions might include:
-- - Opportunity sources (linkedin, indeed, etc.)
-- - Default subscription plans
-- - System configuration values

-- Placeholder to ensure the file is valid SQL
