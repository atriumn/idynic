# About Page Design

## Overview

A product-forward About page for Idynic that establishes legitimacy and communicates the mission without heavy company/founder details.

**Route:** `/about`
**Tone:** Confident and empowering
**Focus:** Mission and values around career empowerment

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero

**Headline:**
> Own Your Career Story

**Subheadline:**
> Idynic brings your scattered career history into one place—and puts it to work for you.

---

### 2. The Problem

**Section heading:** *The reality of job searching*

**Block 1: Scattered identity**
> Your career lives in fragments—old resumes, LinkedIn updates, performance reviews, half-remembered project wins. When opportunity knocks, you're scrambling to piece it together.

**Block 2: Application fatigue**
> Every job wants a tailored pitch. So you rewrite, reformat, and second-guess yourself—over and over. It's exhausting, and it shouldn't be this hard.

---

### 3. The Solution

**Section heading:** *How Idynic helps*

**1. Capture everything** *(icon: layers or archive)*
> Upload resumes, write stories, add project docs. Idynic extracts and organizes your career evidence automatically.

**2. Build your identity** *(icon: fingerprint or user)*
> Your skills, impact, and experience connect into a unified career identity—one source of truth you control.

**3. Tailor in seconds** *(icon: sparkles or target)*
> Paste a job description. Get a customized profile with talking points matched to what they're looking for.

---

### 4. The Vision

**Section heading:** *What we believe*

> Your career is more than a list of job titles. It's the problems you've solved, the impact you've made, and the skills you've built along the way. We're building Idynic to help you see that full picture—and show it to the world on your terms.

### 5. Footer CTA

**Headline:**
> Ready to take control?

**Button:** "Get Started" → `/login`

**Subtle text:**
> Free to start. Your data stays yours.
